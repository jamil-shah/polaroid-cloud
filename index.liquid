  <p>
    With Polaroid Cloud, you can sync your photos to your favorite cloud service 
    while still enjoying the instant printing youâ€™ve come to expect from Polaroid. 
    Using our special instant photo paper, your image is uploaded to the web and a QR code 
    is generated and printed with the instant photo. Perfect for sharing with your friends 
    and family!
